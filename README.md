# Data_Augmentation_LLM
This project shows how to do error analysis and generate synthetic data through LLM to improve your model. The details can be found in this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@rajdeep.jzs/data-centric-ai-in-action-boosting-model-performance-with-synthetic-data-from-large-language-8340b902719f).

In this use-case based hands on project, you will learn the following:
- How to perform error analysis
- Decide on what data you need to improve your model
- How to create relevant prompt and use few-shot generation
- How to use an open-source LLM to generate synthetic data 
- Use the generated data to build your model
